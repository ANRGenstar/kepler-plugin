# kepler-plugin
plugin to use genstar inside the Kepler scientific workflow


# What is Kepler? 

Kepler is a scientific workflow. All the details are there: [link](https://kepler-project.org/)

# How to develop it? 

have a look to:
* how to retrieve a development version of Kepler, and build it with Eclipse: [link](https://kepler-project.org/developers/reference/kepler-and-eclipse) and [link](https://kepler-project.org/developers/teams/build/documentation/developing-a-hello-world-actor-using-the-kepler-build-system-and-eclipse)

reference documents:
* developer reference guide for Kepler: [link](https://kepler-project.org/developers/reference)
* read the user guide of Kepler: [link](https://code.kepler-project.org/code/kepler-docs/trunk/outreach/documentation/shipping/2.5/UserManual.pdf) 
* the Ptolemy II reference guide, especially of interest to understand advanced workflows or how to deal with types [link](http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptII8.1/ptII8.0.1/doc/release.htm)

## how to add an actor? 
* you'll need an LSID: [link](https://kepler-project.org/developers/teams/framework/kepler-life-science-identifiers-keplerlsid)

## how to package it as a Kepler plugin? 

you'll need to create a MOML file [link](http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptII8.1/ptII8.0.1/doc/release.htm), [link](https://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/publications/papers/00/moml/moml_erl_memo.pdf)
